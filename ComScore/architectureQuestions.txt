We had discussion with Hugo on understanding the requirements for ComScore project. Below are the points we have discussed in the meeting 

Suresh introduced Aparn and Nagaraju to Hugo.
Hugo shared his complete experience with comscore and technology stack currently they are using.

90% of the Comscore infrastructure is on AWS cloud and remaining is in on-premise
Multiple developers are working and making commits depends on necessary changes. Following pull requests mechanism to validate the changes.
Hugo intrested in implementing Git Branching strategy and having some gated build mechanism to verify DAG files syantax and etc..
Jenkins is using for Continuous Integration, raising the tickets in Jira to track the changes
Jenkins pipelines not fully implemented, Intrested in implementing single click deployment to multiple environments with single pipeline.
On-prem infrastructure is monitoring by Nagios, cloud servers with cloudwatch service and EMR with Ganglia tool.
Discussed on containerizing current airflow server and managing them in different environments.


Is your ETV running in prod?
How you are deploying? What are the steps you follow to deploy
What you will do in staging environments or in dev environments (How do we do testing)
To implement CICD SQL files copying is enough or we should do anything else?
